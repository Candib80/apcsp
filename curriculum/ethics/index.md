## Notes

- We might think of ethics as whether we *should* do something, or *how* we go about doing it, even when we have the ability to.
- For example, we can now use code to send lots of emails, creating more spam. We can collect passwords for our website with a form, and if a user uses that same password for another site, we end up with access to their account unless we store the passwords securely.
- JavaScript, too, can be used to log users’ actions on our sites, like items they’ve added to their cart. But logging all actions, over time, can cause worry for users’ privacy.
- Before Facebook, the website, there was another website, [Facemash](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2003/11/19/facemash-creator-survives-ad-board-the/), where code was used to scrape, or download, images of Harvard students and use them without prior permission.
- With some colleagues from the Department of Philosophy, Meica Magnani and Susan Kennedy, we discuss some frameworks for making decisions more rigorously.
- The [Embedded EthiCS](https://embeddedethics.seas.harvard.edu/) program at Harvard integrates tools for ethical reasoning into computer science courses, to help ensure that future computer scientists will be creating and using technology ethically.
