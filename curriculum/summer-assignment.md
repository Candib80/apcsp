# Welcome to AP Computer Science Principles (AP CSP)

Hello! I am happy to have you in my AP Computer Science Principles class for the 2023-2024 school year! 

This class is about the principles that underlie much of the technology around us. Your job as a student in the class is to be on the lookout, to be alert, for where and how computer science affects or impacts the things you care about, the things you know about. Whatever it is you want to do in your life, it is likely that technology affects it in some way, or that some technological innovation is needed.

This course is about creativity, technology and innovation. In this class, you will often be asked to invent your own solution to problems. Even if it is a problem that has been solved before, thinking like a computer scientist requires a different mindset. We study a lot of things in this class not only because itâ€™s foundational knowledge, but because of the way it makes you think, the way it asks you solve problems.

Inventing things, and having insights about how things work, and how they might work better is what this class is about. The goal of the summer assignment is to get you started on this way of thinking as well as get you familiar with what a computer actually is.

I look forward to having you all in the fall, and have a great rest of your summer break! If you ever need me, email me at <cbeaman@parrottacademy.org>.

## Summer Assignment 2023 

- The assignment below is due the first day we all meet and will count as a **Major** grade
- **There will be a test on Friday, August 25** on material covered in the assignment; however, we will review before.

### Part 0
- Join the CodeHS Section for this summer here: [https://codehs.com/go/2630D](https://codehs.com/go/2630D)
  - We will only be using CodeHS for the summer assignment to introduce programming and what computing is
- Download the [Guided Notes](\apcsp\assets\pdfs\summer\summer-23.pdf) and complete as you go through the first part within CodeHS
- Try your best on the quizzes, but those will not be for a grade, rather your test the first week will determine your knowledge on the subject

### Part 1
- Complete the **What is Computing?** section on CodeHS & complete the notes you downloaded
- Make sure to complete the free response parts within CodeHS!

### Part 2
- Complete the **Programming With Karel** section on CodeHS
