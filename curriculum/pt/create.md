# Create Performance Task

## General Requirements

Complete and submit the following via [Digital Portfolio](https://digitalportfolio.collegeboard.org/):
- Final program code (created independently or collaboratively)
- A video that displays the running of your program and demonstrates functionality you developed (created independently)
- Code Segments for your Personalized Project Reference (created independently)

## Component A: Program Code

Submit one PDF file that contains all of your program code (including comments). Include comments or acknowledgments for any part of the 
submitted program code that has been written by someone other than you and/or your collaborative partner(s).

In your program, you must include student-developed program code that contains the following:
- Instructions for input from one of the following:
  - the user (including user actions that trigger events)
  - a device
  - an online data stream
  - a file
- Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the program’s purpose
- At least one procedure that contributes to the program’s intended purpose, where you have defined:
  - the procedure’s name
  - the return type (if necessary)
  - one or more parameters
- An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure
- Calls to your student-developed procedure 
- Instructions for output (tactile, audible, visual, or textual) based on input and program functionality

**Submission Reminders**  
Before you submit your work as final, please:
- Remove your name.
- Ensure that you have provided acknowledgement for any program code written by someone else.
- Refrain from publicly posting any portion of your performance task. Work that is shared online is subject to being plagiarized by another student. When this happens both students will be flagged for plagiarism.

## Component B: Video

Submit one video file that demonstrates the running of your program as described below. Collaboration is not allowed during the development of your video.

Your video must demonstrate your program running, including:
  - Input to your program
  - At least one aspect of the functionality of your program
  - Output produced by your program

Your video may NOT contain:
  - Any distinguishing information about yourself
  - Voice narration (though text captions are encouraged)
  
Your video must be:
  - Either .webm, .mp4, .wmv, .avi, or .mov format
  - No more than 1 minute in length
  - No more than 30MB in file size

**Submission Reminders**  
Before submitting your work as final, please:
- Remove your name.
- Ensure that you have not collaborated on the development of this video.
- Refrain from publicly posting any portion of your performance task. Work that is shared online is subject to being plagiarized by another student. When this happens both students will be flagged for plagiarism.

## Component C: Personalized Project Reference

To assist in responding to the written response prompts on exam day, submit required portions of your code by capturing and pasting program code segments you developed during the administration of this task. Screen captures should not be blurry, and text should be at least 10-point font size. **Your code segments should not include any comments.** These code segments will be made available to you on exam day only if this component is submitted as final in the AP Digital Portfolio by the deadline.

- **Procedure:** Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a student-developed procedure that implements an algorithm used in your program and a call to that procedure. 
  1. The first program code segment must be a student-developed procedure that:
    - Defines the procedure’s name and return type (if necessary)
    - Contains and uses one or more parameters that have an effect on the functionality of the procedure
    - Implements an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration
  2. The second program code segment must show where your student-developed procedure is being called in your program.

- **List:** Capture and paste two program code segments you developed during the administration of this task that contain a list (or other collection type) being used to manage complexity in your program. 
  1. The first program code segment must show how data have been stored in the list.
  2. The second program code segment must show the data in the same list being used, such as creating new data from the existing
data or accessing multiple elements in the list, as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose.

**Submission Reminder**  
Before submitting your work as final, please:
- Do not include your name.
- Ensure that you have not collaborated on the Personalized Project Reference.
- Refrain from publicly posting any portion of your performance task. Work that is shared online is subject to being plagiarized by another student. When this happens both students will be flagged for plagiarism.
