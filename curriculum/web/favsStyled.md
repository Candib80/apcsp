# Styling MyFavs

### tl;dr: Add css to the exercise "MyFavs"

Your goal is to make this look "presentable". Don't add random colors and sizes to things. Find colors that compliment each other. Size your elements so they're not awkwardly big or small. As a web developer it's important to create UI that is appealing to the user. You don't have to become an expert designer by any means - but it's a good practice to "care" about the look of the projects you build.

You will create a `favStyles.css` file for your `favs.html` and link it in the head of your html file. The following should be in your css file:

1. Add a border of your choice to all `table`, `th`, `tr`, `td` elements
1. Add a 10px padding to the right and left of every `<td>` element using the padding shorthand method
1. Add a max width to all images so all the table cells display more evenly - take out of your HTML file and put into your CSS file
1. Make all the table cells an even width
1. Make all the text in your ordered lists in the "Fav" column blue
1. Make all the text in your ordered lists in the "Not Fav" column red
1. Add a font color and background color of your choice to the table headers
1. Add rounded corners to all your images
