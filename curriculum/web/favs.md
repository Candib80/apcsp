# Exercise: Favs

### tl;dr: Create a table listing your "favorite" and "not so favorite" things. The table MUST include the following:

1. Page Header
1. Table
1. Table headers for each category (favorite / not favorite)
1. Five rows
1. Each row will have two cells. (One cell for "favorite" and "not favorite")
1. Each cell must include a title, image and ordered list of 2-3 reasons it's your favorite/not favorite thing.
1. All images should include proper attributes to meet W3C guidelines - `alt` attribute
1. Try to use images no larger than 256x256 to keep a "balanced" looking table.

Bonus Challenge: Here's a CSS snippet you can include to get a visual for the table borders. If you don't know how to link CSS into your HTML..."use the Google" ðŸ˜‰

```css
table, th, tr, td {
 border: 1px solid black;
}

td {
 padding: 0 10px;
}
```
