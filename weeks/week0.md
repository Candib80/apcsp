### Set up GitHub & VS Code:
- In the order listed, do the following for GitHub:  
  1. In order to submit problem sets, you'll need an account on GitHub:
    - If you don't already have one, visit [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and create an account (for free). Make sure to use an email that you have access to. **Take care to remember your username and password!** 
  1. [Fill out this form](https://forms.microsoft.com/r/sqmw77BXt5); must log into your APA Microsoft account to answer
- Then move on to setting up VS Code:  
    Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code) is a popular ‚Äúintegrated development environment‚Äù (IDE) via which you can write code. So that you don‚Äôt have to download, install, and configure your own copy of VS Code, we‚Äôll use a cloud-based version instead that has everything you‚Äôll need pre-installed.

    1. Log into [cs50.dev/](https://cs50.dev/) using your GitHub account and follow the on-screen instructions to set up your very own ‚Äúcodespace‚Äù for Visual Studio Code. Once your codespace loads, you should see that, by default, VS Code is divided into three regions. Toward the top of VS Code is your ‚Äútext editor,‚Äù where you‚Äôll write all of your programs. Toward the bottom is a ‚Äúterminal window,‚Äù a command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to explore your codespace‚Äôs files and directories (aka folders), compile code, and run programs. And on the left is your file ‚Äúexplorer,‚Äù a graphical user interface (GUI) via which you can also explore your codespace‚Äôs files and directories.
    1. Once your codespace has loaded, close any Welcome tabs that might have opened by default
    1. Log into submit.cs50.io using your GitHub account and click Authorize cs50 to activate check50.
    1. Run update50 in your codespace‚Äôs terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, if prompted, click Rebuild now.
