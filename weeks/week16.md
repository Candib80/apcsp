### Review Practice:

1. Write a program to accept two integers and check whether they are equal or not.  
Test Data : 15 15  
Expected Output :  
Number1 and Number2 are equal.

1. Write a program to compute the sum of the two input values. If the two values are the same, then return triple their sum.

3. Write a program that checks two given integers and returns true if at least one of them is 30 or if their sum is 30. In other words, if either of the two integers is 30 or if their sum equals 30, the program will return true.

4. Write a program to check a given integer and return true if it is within 10 of 100 or 200.

5. Write a program to read the age of a candidate and determine whether he is eligible to cast his/her own vote.  
Test Data : 21  
Expected Output :  
Congratulations! You are eligible for casting your vote.  

1. Write a program in C to display the first 10 natural numbers.  
Expected Output :  
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

2. Write a C program to compute the sum of the first 10 natural numbers.  
Expected Output :  
The first 10 natural number is :  
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  
The Sum is : 55

2. Write a program in C to read n number of values in an array and display them in reverse order.  
Test Data :  
Input the number of elements to store in the array :3  
Input 3 number of elements in the array :  
element - 0 : 2  
element - 1 : 5  
element - 2 : 7  
Expected Output :  
The values store into the array are :  
2 5 7  
The values store into the array in reverse are :  
7 5 2
